## Motivation
Stock investment can be very intimidating to beginners.
They risk losing their money in a game that they don't know how to play.\
With that in mind, MoneyVestor is tailored to introduce beginner investors to investing concepts in a no-risk environment.

AS a beginner investor - I want to understand the stock market in simple terms and practice making transactions with fake money.\
SO THAT - I can feel more confident when making stock transactions in real life.
